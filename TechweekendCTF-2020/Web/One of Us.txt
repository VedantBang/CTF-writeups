The landing page says "Special Coupon for our most Elite members!" and has a link "Click here to receive Special Coupon!!"
Clicking the link takes you to a page which says TECHWKND{y0u_n0t_th4t_sm4rt} which is the fake flag.

Looking at the source code there is a script file https://cte.bitskrieg.org/web_chall2/main.b3fa6e8c66e20f103ac6.js

The script file has minified code, and on the second last line, there is a statement:
window.location.replace('./fYWBLFU.html')

Going to /fYWBLFU.html we get the real flag
